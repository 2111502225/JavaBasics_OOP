` Share your assignment on GitHub:`

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (If You Don't Have One)

You'll need to create a GitHub account if you don't already have one. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign up for a free account.

### Step 2: Create a New Repository

1. Click on the '+' icon in the top right corner of the GitHub homepage.
2. Select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.
3. Choose a repository name (for example, `JavaBasicsHomework`).
4. Select **Public**.
5. Initialize this repository with a README (optional).
6. Click on the "Create repository" button.

### Step 3: Write Your Java Code

Write your Java solutions in a single file named `Homework.java` on your computer using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

### Step 4: Add and Commit Your Code to the Repository

1. Open Git Bash (or your preferred Git client).
2. Navigate to the directory where your `Homework.java` file is located using the `cd` command.
3. Initialize a new Git repository in your project folder with the following command:
   ```
   git init
   ```
4. Add the `Homework.java` file to the staging area:
   ```
   git add Homework.java
   ```
5. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add Java homework solutions."
   ```

### Step 5: Link the Local Repository to the GitHub Repository

1. On the GitHub repository page, copy the repository URL (it should look like `https://github.com/username/JavaBasicsHomework.git`).
2. Link your local repository to the GitHub repository using the following command (replace `<repository-url>` with the URL you copied):
   ```
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```

### Step 6: Push Your Changes to GitHub

Push your committed changes to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### Step 7: Verify Your Submission

1. Visit your GitHub repository in your web browser to ensure that your `Homework.java` file has been successfully uploaded.
2. Double-check that your code is correct and well-formatted.

### Step 8: Submit the GitHub Repository Link

Submit the link to your GitHub repository (for example, `https://github.com/username/JavaBasicsHomework`) before the deadline provided in the assignment.

These steps will allow you to submit your Java homework assignment on GitHub. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help!
