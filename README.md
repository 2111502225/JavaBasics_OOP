## Assignment Overview

In this set of 25 assignments, you will explore different Java programming concepts and apply them to solve a variety of problems. The assignments cover topics such as basic syntax, loops, conditional statements, arrays, object-oriented programming, file handling, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before starting these assignments, make sure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of Java syntax.
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor for writing Java code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd JavaAssignments
   ```
3. Create a new Java file for each assignment (e.g., `Assignment1.java`, `Assignment2.java`, etc.) and write your solutions in these files.
